# om-next-05

Simple example based around [om-next](https://github.com/omcljs/om/wiki/Components,-Identity-&-Normalization)

Two list remotes :list1 :list2 (public/list1.json, public/list2.json)

List data is merged together - normalized by om.next to present view

## Overview

## Setup

Intellij - Cursive - REPL

![Figwheel Idea Cursive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/griffio/griffio.github.io/master/public/figwheel-idea.png)

Open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
